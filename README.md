# Systems-and-Ports
nmap interface in BASH for scanning known IPs and parsing to a document in the directory for easy reporting.

This could be useful for intel gathering about the local network or any IP I suppose. The script is set up to identify the OS,
common open ports, and other useful things. All of this script uses the nmap protocols and can be modified very easily by anyone
who knows bash scripting as well as nmap commands. 

I may add to this, I may not. It's not particularly advanced, but it is easy to use and is a good tool for beginners though
it is really only useful in a lab setting as most of nmap's function breaks US law without explicit permission.

# USE
Put ips in the "ips.txt" document. Run the program from the right directory using "bash <location of Systems&Ports>/init.sh".
